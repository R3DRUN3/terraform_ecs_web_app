## Terraform

<p align="center"><img width="180" height="180" src="https://github.com/yurijserrano/Github-Profile-Readme-Logos/blob/master/cloud/terraform.png"></p>

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. Users define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON. 

With the advent of the Cloud and programmable infrastructures, Terraform is acquiring momentum as it helps incredibly with the deployment and maintenance of IaaS.
Terraform relies on plugins called "providers" to interact with cloud providers, SaaS providers, and other APIs.
The software is compliant with the biggest cloud providers including aws, Azure and GCP.

## AWS ECS

<p align="center"><img width="180" height="180" src="https://github.com/yurijserrano/Github-Profile-Readme-Logos/blob/master/cloud/amazon.svg"></p>

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable and fast container management service. You can use it to run, stop and manage containers on a cluster. With Amazon ECS, your containers are defined through a process definition used to run individual processes or processes within a service. In this context, a service is a configuration that you can use to simultaneously run and manage a specified number of processes in a cluster. You can run processes and services on a serverless infrastructure managed by AWS Fargate. Alternatively, for more control over your infrastructure, you can run your processes and services on a cluster of self-managed Amazon EC2 instances.

## Docker 

<p align="center"><img width="180" height="180" src="https://github.com/yurijserrano/Github-Profile-Readme-Logos/blob/master/cloud/docker.svg"></p>

Docker is a platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. 
The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine. 
It was first started in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc.

## Case Study

This repo contains a real-life use case of a containerized web app deployment via ECS by automating infrastructure deployment through Terraform.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be pre-installed on the client machine in order to perform the procedure correctly:

| Software | Description | Installation Guide |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Terraform` | Infrastructure as a Service Software | https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli |
| `aws cli` | Command Line Interface for aws resources management | https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html |
| `docker` | Software container deployment tool | https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ |

## Usage
clone this repo:

```console
git clone https://github.com/R3DRUN3/terraform_ecs_web_app.git && cd terraform_ecs_web_app
```
Make *deploy.sh* executable:

```console
 chmod +x deploy.sh
 ```
Launch the script and follow instructions:
```console
 ./deploy.sh
 ```
 Output Sample:
```console

- Finding hashicorp/aws versions matching "~> 3.27"...
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v3.75.2

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

..................................................
..................................................
..................................................
..................................................

Plan: 14 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  + cluster_name = "my-cluster"
  + website_url  = (known after apply)

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

aws_default_subnet.default_subnet_a: Creating...
aws_iam_role.ecsTaskExecutionRole: Creating...

..................................................
..................................................

..................................................

Apply complete! Resources: 14 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

cluster_name = "my-cluster"
website_url = "load-balancer-dev-2135541272.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
